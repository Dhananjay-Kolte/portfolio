                        Led the backend for a B2B marketplace that handles fast-moving consumer goods. I built
                        microservices for user onboarding, KYC/KYB checks, inventory from multiple suppliers, and
                        logistics tracking. Set up automated workflows that cut manual work by 60%. Plugged in payment
                        APIs, Zoho Sign for e-signatures, and notifications via email, SMS, and in-app. Used Cursor and
                        Claude Code for quick prototyping and code reviews, which saved us around 40% of development
                        time. Also ran code reviews and helped the team pick up AI-assisted workflows.

                        and all the compliance checks. Led code reviews, set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and mentored
                        3+ developers. Used Cursor and GitHub Copilot to build services faster, write tests, and run
                        security checks — saved us about 30% of dev time. The platform hit 99.9% uptime while handling

                        Set up login with AWS Cognito and used both RDS and MongoDB depending on the data needs.
                        Put together CI/CD pipelines with CloudFormation and monitoring with CloudWatch so we could

                            Therapy providers needed a way to see patients online, but the platform had to be rock-solid
                            on privacy — HIPAA, PHIPA, and GDPR all had to be covered. Patient data security was non-negotiable.

                        <p>
                            Built the backend with microservices, added end-to-end encryption, JWT login, and hooked up
                            WebRTC for video/audio calls. Added real-time chat using WebSockets and built practice management
                            features. Also added an AI chatbot that handles patient intake and books appointments, which
                            took a lot of load off the front desk. Used Cursor and GitHub Copilot to write code faster and
                            keep quality high. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions and AWS CodeDeploy.

                            The platform runs at 99.9% uptime and connects therapists with patients worldwide.
                            The AI chatbot now handles 35% of patient intake questions on its own.
                            Stayed fully HIPAA compliant while supporting thousands of sessions at the same time.
                            Mentored 3+ developers, which helped improve code quality by 40% and cut bugs by 30%.

                            FMCG businesses needed one place to restock products, manage inventory from different suppliers,
                            track deliveries, and handle payments — all while staying compliant with regulations.

                        <p>
                            Built a B2B marketplace with role-based access, automated inventory management, and live
                            logistics tracking. Added GDPR-compliant user management, KYC/KYB checks, contract signing with
                            Zoho Sign, and notifications through email, SMS, and in-app. Built an AI-based demand forecasting
                            tool that suggests when to restock, and a smart search that finds products across suppliers.
                            Used Claude Code and Cursor to prototype features fast and automate code reviews. Also built
                            dashboards for logistics timelines and financial reporting.

                            Cut manual processing time by 60% with automation. The AI forecasting improved restocking
                            accuracy by 25%. Made it easy to pull inventory from multiple suppliers in one view.
                            Onboarding got faster with automated compliance checks. Hooked up 5+ third-party services
                            while keeping 99.5% uptime and API responses under 200ms.

                            Connected the platform to Cerner, Nextgen, and AthenaHealth EHRs using REST APIs and HL7.
                            Built an AI voice agent that calls patients to confirm or reschedule appointments, which
                            really helped with no-shows. Also added an AI chatbot inside the portal for patient triage
                            and common questions. Set up real-time chat with WebSockets, push notifications via Pusher,
                            and admin modules for specialists, facilities, and billing.

                        I've added AI features into real products — things like smart search, recommendation
                        systems, auto-generated content, and prediction tools. I know how to plug LLMs and AI
                        APIs into Java/Spring Boot apps and make them work in production.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I build AI agents that can handle tasks on their own — think multi-step workflows where the
                        agent talks to APIs, reads from databases, and follows business rules to get things done
                        without someone watching over it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>AI Voice Agents & Chatbots</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've built voice bots that make phone calls to patients for appointment reminders, and chatbots
                        that handle customer questions and triage. I work with speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and
                        natural language understanding to make these conversations feel real.

    <!-- Architecture & System Design -->
    <section id="architecture" class="architecture">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">How I Build Systems</h2>
            <div class="architecture-content">
                <div class="architecture-text">
                    <h3>How I Think About Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        I keep things simple: build systems that can grow, stay secure, and don't break at 3 AM.
                        I like clean separation between services, cloud-native setups, and code that's easy
                        for the next developer to understand.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What I Follow</h3>
                    <ul class="architecture-principles">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Microservices:</strong> I break things into small, independent services with
                            clear APIs. Each service can be deployed, scaled, and updated on its own.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Event-Driven Design:</strong> I use message queues like Kafka, RabbitMQ,
                            and SQS so services don't depend on each other too much. This makes the system
                            more reliable and easier to scale.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Security First:</strong> I don't bolt security on at the end. I use Spring
                            Security, JWT, encryption everywhere, and compliance controls (HIPAA, GDPR) from
                            day one.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Monitoring:</strong> I set up CloudWatch, structured logs, and distributed
                            tracing so when something goes wrong, I can find and fix it fast.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Everything goes through Terraform or
                            CloudFormation. No manual server setup, no "it works on my machine" problems.
                            CI/CD handles the rest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Right Database for the Job:</strong> I pick SQL when I need strict transactions
                            and NoSQL when the data is flexible. Add proper indexing, Redis caching, and
                            connection pooling to keep things fast.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Building for Scale</h3>
                    <p>
                        I build systems that can handle growth — horizontal scaling, stateless services, Redis
                        caching, and database read replicas. I've used AWS serverless (Lambda, API Gateway) to
                        go from zero to thousands of requests per second without worrying about servers. I've
                        applied these patterns on real systems handling healthcare data, payments, and live video.
